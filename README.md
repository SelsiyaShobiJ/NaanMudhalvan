1. Military Soldier Safety and Weapon Detection
This project uses YOLO and computer vision to detect weapons, enemy soldiers, and vehicles in real-time, enhancing military surveillance and soldier safety. It helps distinguish threats from civilians and supports battlefield awareness through a user-friendly Streamlit app.

2. Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Computer Vision
This project automates brain tumor detection from MRI scans using OpenCV and deep learning. It improves diagnostic accuracy and speeds up treatment planning, offering consistent tumor segmentation through a simple web-based interface.

3. Number Plate Detection of Vehicles
This system detects vehicle number plates using YOLO and extracts text with OCR for applications like traffic monitoring and parking control. Deployed via a Streamlit app, it ensures fast and accurate detection across varied environments.
